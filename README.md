# Apex-RebuildCX 

Putting together an Apex Legends ingame M0DmENu Aka "cxCheats" source code. 

My reasoning behind this attempt to patch is the owners decietful actions and the route of production scheme is scammy and faulty.
  Eexample -- random restricted access before time of purchase expires.
  Constant background downloads and malicious scans including personal and local information about files, folders, running services and its content.
  Using several data collection ajd compiler schemes.
  Goes through cache to upload to server and recycles=no trace[intended collection act]
  Many more reasons to expose this. 
  Any contributions are welcome.
  
  Thanks.

Project currently under heavy research, any help appriciated.
